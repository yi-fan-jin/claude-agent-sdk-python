        Contract: the SDK calls this from inside a shielded ``anyio`` cancel
        scope, so cancellation from an enclosing *anyio* scope (a task-group
        failure, an expiring ``move_on_after``, a cancelled anyio task) will
        *not* interrupt it, and cleanup runs to completion. But an
        implementation that blocks forever here blocks the caller's
        ``__aexit__``/``disconnect()`` forever with no way out.

        (An anyio shield does not stop a *raw asyncio* cancellation —
        ``asyncio.wait_for``/``asyncio.timeout`` firing, a bare
        ``task.cancel()``, loop shutdown — from being delivered at an await
        inside ``close()``. Implementations that must clean up on that path
        should not rely on the shield alone.)

        Implementations must bound their own awaits (e.g. wrap them in
        ``anyio.move_on_after``/``anyio.fail_after``, whose deadlines still
        fire inside the shield) rather than relying on the caller to cancel
        them.
